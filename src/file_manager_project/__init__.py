# This file makes 'file_manager_project' a Python package.

# We can expose key classes or functions here for easier imports by users of the package.
# For example:
# from .file_handler import FileHandler
# from .workspace_manager import WorkspaceManager
# from .exceptions import FileManagerError

# For now, keeping it simple. Users will import directly from modules.
# This also helps avoid circular import issues during initial refactoring.
# Later, we can decide what to expose at the package level.
